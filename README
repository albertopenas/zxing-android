NOTE: THIS IS A VERY OLD UNSUPPORTED REPO.

Custom build of Barcode Scanner for Android which forces the preview display to use portrait mode.  This build also contains some hacks to make scanning faster.  The application I was developing needed a bit faster scanning, so I cut out the delay after a barcode is found.  It should instantly send the data back to the Intent that requested it. 

Works on NexusS4G with zxing 1.7 source as a base.
